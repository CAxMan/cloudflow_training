# Level 3: Creation of new services
This level of tutorials covers topics where actual code needs to be touched and
changed.

## Basics
* **[Tutorial 3-1: Deploy and modify synchronous calculator webservice](python_async_calculator.md)**
  
  This tutorial teaches you how to deploy and modify one of the code examples,
  namely the synchronous Calculator webservice implemented in Python. Good as a
  starting point in the service development.

* **[Tutorial 3-2: Create a simple asynchronous service](python_async_waiter.md)**

  This tutorial guides you through the deployment steps of a simple
  asynchronous service. Starting from a simply Python script representing a
  long-running computation, we will wrap an asynchronous web service around it
  which can be deployed in the CloudFlow infrastructure stack.
