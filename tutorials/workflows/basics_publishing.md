# Tutorial: Publishing workflows
In this tutorial we publish the workflow we have created in the [previous tutorial](basics_editing.md), such that it will be registered in the portal and can be executed from the __Inventory__.

1. To start, navigate to __WF Editor__ -> __Publish workflows__. Here you can see all published workflows.

3. At the top, select your workflow, provide a name, optionally add a description and activate __Show on portal__. At the bottom, select the category __Additional tools__ and click __Add__.

4. If you are ready, click on __Save__. Then, a new button __Publish__ appears. Click on it to finalize this tutorial.
